  <h1>My Biography</h1>

  <hr>

  <p title = "intro">
    Hi, my name is Neil John Rivera,
    19-year-old college student living in San Rafael,
    Barili, Cebu. I am pursuing Bachelor of Science in Information
    Techonology here in CTU - Barili Campus.
    I'm a game addict that I usually spend my time playing video games.
  </p>

  <p title = "ending">
    Since I'm an IT student, I would like to develop my own game
    someday when I learn more about programming and its different langauges needed.
    But sometimes, I doubt if i'd be able to become a programmer/developer since
    I easily forgets and I lack confidence to be one. If IT carrer is not for me,
    I would pursue my second choice, which is graphic designing. I started getting
    hooked up with graphic design a year ago after seeing designs that really catches
    attention to viewers and audience. So I tried it for my self and practices every
    day to enhance my skill and understand the techniques and stuff of graphics design.
